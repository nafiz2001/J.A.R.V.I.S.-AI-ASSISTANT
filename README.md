# J.A.R.V.I.S. AI ASSISTANT
 # JervisAI: A Voice and Text Controlled Virtual Assistant  JervisAI is a Python-based virtual assistant inspired by the J.A.R.V.I.S. system from the Iron Man movies.  It combines voice control, text input, a graphical user interface (GUI), and the power of Google's Gemini AI to provide a versatile and extensible personal assistant.  ## Features  *   **Voice ControlOkay, here's a project description and name suitable for uploading to GitHub, along with some additional helpful information for your repository:  **Project Name:**  JervisAI (:**  Use natural language voice commands to interact with JervisAI.  Activate voice control with "start listening" and deactivate with "stop listening". *   **Text Input:**  Type commands directly into the GUI text box. *   or Jervis-AI, or JervisPersonalAssistant - choose one that's available)  **Project Description (Short, for the GitHub "About" section**GUI:**  A user-friendly Tkinter-based graphical interface displays messages, responses, and provides buttons for key actions. *   **Gemini AI Integration:**  Leverage the power of Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding and response generation.  Activate AI mode with the "ai" command):**  > A Python-based, voice-controlled personal assistant with a Tkinter GUI, integrating Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding and response and deactivate with "exit ai". *   **Extensible Command Structure:**  Easily add new commands and functionality by modifying the `process_command` function. *   **Core Functionality:**     *   Open and close applications (Notepad, Chrome, WhatsApp - *configurable*).      generation.  **Project Description (Longer, for your README.md file):**  ```markdown # JervisAI: Your Voice-Controlled Personal Assistant  JervisAI is a personal assistant built in Python that combines voice control*   Open websites (YouTube, Google - *configurable*).     *   Perform Google searches.     *   Search Wikipedia for information.     *   Play music from a designated music directory.     *   Tell jokes.     *   Control system volume (increase, decrease, mute).     *   , a graphical user interface (GUI), and the power of Google's Gemini AI.  It's designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing you to add your own commands and features.  ## Features  *   **Voice Control:**  Take and read notes (saved to `notes.txt`).     *   Shutdown or restart the computer.     *   List available commands.     *   "Text Mode" to temporarily disable voice responses.     *   Dedicated "AI Mode" for direct interaction with Gemini.  ## Requirements  *   PythonUse your voice to interact with JervisAI.  Just say "start listening" to begin, and "stop listening" to pause voice input. *   **Text Input:**  Type commands directly into the GUI's text entry box. *   **GUI:**  A user-friendly Tkinter- 3.7+ *   `pyttsx3`: Text-to-speech library. *   `speech_recognition`: Voice recognition library. *   `pypiwin32`:  Windows API bindings (for some system commands). *   `psutil`: Process management library. *   based interface displays messages, responses, and provides buttons for common actions. *   **Gemini AI Integration:**  Leverages Google's Gemini AI for natural language understanding and intelligent responses.  Say "ai [your query]" to enter AI mode, and "exit ai" to return to normal command processing. *   **Extensible Command Structure:**  Easily add new commands and functionality by modifying the `process_command` function. *   **Built-in Commands:**     *   **Application Control:** Open and close applications (Notepad, Chrome, WhatsApp - *paths may need configuration*).     *   **Web`requests`: HTTP library for API requests. *   `wikipedia`:  Wikipedia API wrapper. *   `tkinter`:  GUI library (usually included with Python). *   `Pillow`: Image processing library (for the optional icon). *  `pyautogui`:  cross platfrom GUI automation library.  ## Installation  1.  **Clone the repository:**      ```bash     git clone <your-repository-url>     cd <your-repository-directory>     ```  2.  **Install dependencies:**      ```bash     pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition Search:** Perform Google searches and open websites (YouTube, Google).     *   **Wikipedia Integration:**  Search Wikipedia and get summaries.     *   **Music Playback:** Play music from a specified directory.     *   **Jokes:**  Hear a random joke.     *   **Volume Control pypiwin32 psutil requests wikipedia Pillow pyautogui     ```     (If you have trouble use `pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition pypiwin32 psutil requests wikipedia Pillow==9.5.0 pyautogui`)  3.  **API Key:**     *   Obtain a:** Adjust system volume (increase, decrease, mute).     *   **Note Taking:**  Dictate notes that are saved to a `notes.txt` file.     *   **Note Reading:**  Read saved notes aloud.     *   **System Control:** Shutdown or restart the computer.     * Google Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/).     *   Create a file named `api_key.txt` in the same directory as the Python script (`jervis.py`).     *   Paste your API key *directly* into `api_key.   **Command Listing:**  List all available commands.     *   **Text Mode:** Switch between voice control and text mode * **Speaking Mode Control** Enable or Disable speaking mode.  ## Prerequisites  *   **Python 3.7+:**  This project is written in Python. *   **txt` (no quotes or extra spaces).  4.  **Configuration (Optional):**     *   **Music Directory:**  Modify the `music_dir` variable in the `play_music()` function to point to your music folder.     *   **Applications:**  Adjust the `apps` dictionary in theRequired Libraries:**  You'll need to install the following libraries using `pip`:      ```bash     pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition pypiwin32 psutil requests wikipedia Pillow tkinter     ```     If there are errors with installation, use:     ```bash         pip install pyttsx3 speech_recognition pypiwin32 psutil requests wikipedia Pillow==9.5.0     ```     If there are any problems, update `pip` and try again:     ```bash     python -m pip install --upgrade pip     ```  *   **Google Gemini API Key `open_application()` function to reflect the correct paths to your applications.     *   **Jervis Icon:** Place a PNG image named `your_jervis_icon.png` in the same directory as the script for a custom icon.  ## Usage  1.  **Run the script:**      ```bash     python jervis.py     ```  2.  **Interaction:**     *   **Voice:** Click "Start Listening" to begin voice commands.
