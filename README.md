Contributing: Encourages contributions.

License: Added License

Additional GitHub Setup Steps:

:** Change the music_dir variable to the absolute path of your music folder. For example:
python music_dir = "C:\\Users\\YourName\\Music" # Windows music_dir = "/home/yourname/Music" # Linux/macOS

open_application() function: Verify the application paths (especially for WhatsApp) are correct for your system. You may need to adjust these. Add any other applications you want to control.

**your_jervis_icon.png (Create a GitHub Repository: Create a new, public repository on GitHub (e.g., named "JervisAI"). Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license yet.

Initialize a Local Git Repository: Open a terminal or command promptOptional):** If you want to use the Jervis icon, place a PNG image file named your_jervis_icon.png in the same directory as the script.

Run JervisAI:

python jervis.py
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

in the directory where your jervis.py file and api_key.txt are located. Run:

```bash
git init
```
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Create a .gitignore file: This is very important. Create a new file named .gitignore in theInteraction:

GUI: The GUI will appear. Messages and responses will be displayed in the text area.

Voice: Click "Start Listening" to activate voice control. Say your commands clearly. Click "Stop Listening" to deactivate.

**Text same directory. Add the following line to it:

api_key.txt
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This prevents you from accidentally committing your API key to the public repository. Never commit your API key!

Add Files:

git:** Type commands into the text entry box and press Enter (or click "Send").
*   **AI Mode:** Say "ai [your query]" to ask Gemini directly. Say "exit ai" to return.
*   **Text Mode:** Say "text mode" to disable voice responses, "exit text mode add .
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This adds all files in the current directory (except those ignored by .gitignore) to the staging area.

Commit Changes:

git commit -m "Initial commit of JervisAI project"
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This creates a commit with" to enable.

"Stop speak": Say "stop speak" to stop voice responses temporarily.

"Start speak": Say "start speak" to re-enable voice responses.

Adding New Commands

To add a new command, follow these steps:

your changes.

Connect to Remote Repository:

git remote add origin <your_repository_url>
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Replace <your_repository_url> with the URL of your new GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your1. Create a Function: Write a Python function that performs the desired action. For example:

def get_weather():
    # ... (Implementation to get weather data) ...
    display_message(f"The weather is...")
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

**Modifyusername/JervisAI.git`).

Rename Branch

git branch -M main
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Push to GitHub:

git push -u origin main
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

This pushes your local commits to the remote GitHub process_command():** Add an elif block to the process_command() function to handle the new command:

elif "weather" in command:
    get_weather()
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Update list_commands(): Add your new command and repository. The -u flag sets up the upstream tracking, so you can use git push and git pull without specifying the branch in the future.

Create a README.md: Copy the project description above and paste it into a new file named README.md in its description to the commands dictionary in the list_commands() function.

Troubleshooting

API Key Issues: Make absolutely sure your api_key.txt file is correctly set up and that you've used the correct key.

Speech Recognition: your project's root directory. Commit and push this file:

git add README.md
git commit -m "Add README.md"
git push
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

Now your project is on GitHub, with a good description, and your API key is safe! If voice recognition is poor, try speaking more clearly, reducing background noise, and adjusting your microphone settings.

Application Paths: Double-check the application paths in open_application().

Missing Libraries: If you get an error about a missing module, make sure you' You can continue to develop your project, commit changes, and push them to GitHub. Remember to always git add and git commit your changes before you git push.
